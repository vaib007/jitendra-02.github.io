<p><h3>Mapping system call with structured output</h3></p>
<h4>Abstract:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify">Strace is microscope for user, but making it more understandable to the user will impact more than it has ever. Why coding standards are fixed? Answer is, programmer does not bother about syntax, only they focus on logic. With period of time eyes of the programmer become very habitual with the syntax and they can easily find out the issues. Mapping of system calls with structured output will help to provide inside view of interaction between kernel space and user space.</p>

<h4>Content:</h4><p style="text-align: justify">
Display data into a proper view always help to find out bug efficiently and rapidly. This mainly focus on the output should be displayed in such a manner so that user will not get any difficulty in finding appropriate data.Prime focus is on to provide effective output format to user so that user can clearly identify relevant data without bothering about the syntax.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Purpose of this proposal:<br/>

1. The output of strace, make it more structural.<br/>

2. Make it as simple as it can be understood by 1st year student completely.<br/>

3. Make it more descriptive.<br/>

4. Make it as so that relevant data should be easily identifiable.<br/>

5. Describe various information regarding system call.<br/>

 

Design :<br/>

Step 1: First user will fire a binary of program with strace command with specified flag.<br/>

Step 2: Whenever strace will detect particular flag then it will perform following steps else it will give result as it is as it gives.<br/>

Step 3: Now it perform mapping of each system call to corresponding formatted output.<br/>

 

Possible output format.<br/>

Structured output format 1: (like a c Structure)<br/>

write{
<br/>
         "arg1:,<br/>

          "arg2",<br/>

           "arg3",<br/>

            info:<br/>

};<br/>

Structured output format 2: (eg. html format)<br/>

 <write info: short discription "msg">
<br/>
                   <![CDATA[<arg1>]]> val1 <![CDATA[<arg1>]]>
<br/>
                   <arg2> val2  </arg2>
<br/>
                   <arg3> val3  </arg3>
<br/>
                  <arg4> val4 </arg4>
<br/>
                  <arg5> val5 </arg5>
<br/>
                   <arg6> val6 </arg6>
<br/>
</write><br/>

Structured output format 3: (eg json)<br/>

 write {<br/>

            "argname": val<br/>

             "argname": val<br/>

             "argname": val<br/>

            "argname": val<br/>

           }

Structured output format 4:<br/>

                          -----------------------------------------<br/>

   	write  ->         |    1, buffer, sizeof(buffer))        |<br/>

                          ------------------------------------------<br/>

 Step 5 : Exit<br/>

 

The structured output in proper format will help to reveal lots of facts of the system and is clearly understandable by the user. Making its output in more systematic manner will  like adding a zooming feature into a microscope. <br/>
As microscope can be used more effectively if it is having a good power of lens in a similar way, as we have structured way of representation is that can easily deliver useful data to the end user .That will increase strace audience area as well as it will be a more strong and powerful tool. <br/>
Strace is a powerful utility but the output of strace is not fully reachable to every programmer/administrator/techie etc.<br/>
My proposal based on this idea to catch that area of the audience which is apart from it because they unable to identify things.<br/>
Certainly, visual effects speak itself, and making it more readable, it will add on the power of strace. Until unless people will not understand the output, how can we think they will enjoy the real power of strace.<br/>
